This repository is dedicated to explain about my project on analysis and create the Machine learning model to clustering the stock pattern and adapt it with trading strategy. Moreover, This is one of the final project of the data master course

## Key Concept :bulb:
<p>The key idea of this project came from the curiousity of mine about why the trader champion can make a profit with the technical data(price, volume).

  If you have ever read the "trade like stock market wizard"(Mark Minervini) or  "How to make money in stocks" (William j o'neil), you would notice that both O'neil and Minervini use the stock moving pattern(VCP, cup with handle etc.) to specify the right time to take action. Morover, these techniques can adapt with almost the stock in the market. So I think that </p>

The key concept of this project is to extract and clustering the pattern of the desire stock. then, predict the near future trend of each pattern group to tell us what action we should do next.

## Process
In order to achieve the goal, I divide the step in to 4 main part which is
1. Data preparation and Preprocess
2. Training the Model
3. Evaluation the model
4. Clustering the signal
